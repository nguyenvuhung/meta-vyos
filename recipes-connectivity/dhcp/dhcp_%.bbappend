# use internal libisc libraries which are based on bind 9.9.11 - there
# is a bug in bind 9.10.x (normally supplied by Yocto) that prevents
# dhcpd/dhclient from shutting down cleanly on sigterm and from running
# in the background
#
# [https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12744]

# This workaround isn't perfect: the bind 9.9.11 libraries will be build
# in ${S}/bind rather than the build directory. But it seems to work for now.
